# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

we're planning on working with the game pong and adding powerups/buffs and making the game progressively more difficult as the player points increase
We are thinking of implenting things like:
changing the paddle size in accordance to score
Making the paddle and ball faster/slower
and adding changes like making the ball invisible, or smaller, or faster, or maybe all three (triple threat?)
