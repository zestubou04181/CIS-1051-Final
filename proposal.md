# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

PONG GAME

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

We will be creating pong and giving it upgrades and just overall making a rather boring and outdated game more entertaining

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We will be taking the game pong and editing it. There will be powerups, new vibrant colors, better sounds, and much more appeal than it once had. We will be using VisualStudioCode and LOVE to build and execute it.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Jude Piacento and Isaac Pointer

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Getting the game completed and being able to start it since I am completely lost on what to do lol. I will at least put a print statement that says "Pong game" on it

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Better is having it fully completed and getting a good grade. I think I can get it done if all of my partners collaborate well

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Wins an award and i become a millionaire game designer lol. jkjk I just want it to run well

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We all split up the upgrades and powerups to make it digestible. Jude tweaked the base game for us though since he felt most confident
